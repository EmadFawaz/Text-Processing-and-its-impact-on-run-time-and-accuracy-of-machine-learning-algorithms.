# Text-Processing-and-its-impact-on-run-time-and-accuracy-of-machine-learning-algorithms.
This repo was built as a reference for my future text processing and text learning efforts. In this work I present steps of text processing and comparing the results of different algorithms in terms of run time and accuracy.
