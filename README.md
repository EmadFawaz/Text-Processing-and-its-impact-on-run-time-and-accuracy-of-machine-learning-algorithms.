# Text-Processing-and-its-impact-on-run-time-and-accuracy-of-machine-learning-algorithms.

## Aim
This repo was built as a reference for my future text processing and text learning efforts. In this work I present steps of text processing and comparing the results of different algorithms in terms of run time and accuracy. 

## Structure
There are mainly two files in this repo. The word document explains the theoretical part behind text processing. The Jupyter Notebook contains the code used. The data used in this project can be easily retrieved using provided code. 

## Language
Python 3

## Results
Text processing will enhance the run time. Processed texts need less time for training and testing. This is crucially important in cases of vast texts.
Nevertheless, the accuracy as well enhanced a little bit after text processing. 
The SVM gave the best accuracy. Yet, it needed significantly more time for training and testing.

## Key words
Text processing, text learning, Machine Learning, NLTK
